# Rerral API Documentation

The purpose of this page is to document the use of BitShares.eu's faucet
**API to register new accounts on BitShares**.

It is important to note that you can use this faucet without having
registered an account on BitShares.eu but will not benefit from the
on-chain [referral program](https://bitshares.org/referral-program/).

In contrast, once you have an account on BitShares.eu, you may created
as many referral codes as you want to

 * track your referred users
 * benefit from the transactions fees that your referred users generated on BitShares
 * obtain additional control over sophisticated faucet parameters (partly premium)

## Basic Endpoint

The general endpoint for referral API is available at

    https://faucet.bitshares.eu

and is fully compatible with the standard BitShares UI.

## Referral Endpoint

By obtaining a referral code, you can also use another endpoint
specifically for your referral code. It takes the form

    https://faucet.bitshares.eu/d6699dec12d341f2

All requests made through this URL will be booked into the referral
program of `d6699dec12d341f2`, accordingly.

## Path

Both endpoints expect the following path in order to reach the actual
faucet:

    /api/v1/accounts

# Rate Limitations

A single IP may only request a new account once per hour.

# Referral Call

In order to create a new account through this faucet, you need a `POST`
request with a JSON formated body.

## Basic JSON format

     {
         "account":{
             "name":"account-name",
             "owner_key":"BTS5WaszCsqVN9hDkXZPMyiUib3dyrEA4yd5kSMgu28Wz47B3wUqa",
             "active_key":"BTS5TPTziKkLexhVKsQKtSpo4bAv5RnB8oXcG4sMHEwCcTf3r7dqE",
             "memo_key":"BTS5TPTziKkLexhVKsQKtSpo4bAv5RnB8oXcG4sMHEwCcTf3r7dqE",
         }
     }

The `*_key` keys have to be valid public keys for the BitShares network!

### Optional Account Keys

Additionally, you may use the following additional keys:

* `refcode`: If no referral code is provided in the endpoint-URL, you
             may define a referral code directly in the request.
* `email`: If provided, an email address can be logged additionally.
           This email address will only be stored on BitShares.eu in
           accordance to the privacy terms.

# Reply

The request's reply will have the following form:

     {
         "account":{
             "name":"account-name",
             "owner_key":"BTS5WaszCsqVN9hDkXZPMyiUib3dyrEA4yd5kSMgu28Wz47B3wUqa",
             "active_key":"BTS5TPTziKkLexhVKsQKtSpo4bAv5RnB8oXcG4sMHEwCcTf3r7dqE",
             "memo_key":"BTS5TPTziKkLexhVKsQKtSpo4bAv5RnB8oXcG4sMHEwCcTf3r7dqE",
             "referrer": "<Name of the referrer account>"
         }
     }
